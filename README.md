# oxidized-patterns
Oxidized Patterns is a collection of classic GoF design patterns alongside Rust-specific idioms, all implemented in safe, idiomatic Rust that leverages Rustâ€™s type system (PhantomData, generics, traits) for compile-time guarantees. Each pattern lives in its own module, is covered by comprehensive tests, and can be explored via an interactive CLI demo.
